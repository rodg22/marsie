            <div class="texto-modal">
              <p>I got into computers as a young 6 year old kid, learning how to code while making a white turtle drawing on a blue screen, just by entering a few simple instructions.<span class="sacarTexto"> Wow! Of course, back then I didn’t know that this was programming, as to me it was only fun and discovery.</span></p>
              <p>
                As years passed, I wanted to become serious about writing code, so I began training and taking part in algorithm coding competitions<span class="sacarEnDesktop">.</span><span class="sacarTexto">, first locally in Mar del Plata, my birth city, and then nationally across Argentina. That was also lots of fun, while it remained a challenge and consequently, turned out to be mind-opening.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                Later in university, formalizing concepts and techniques, and learning many new details about Software Engineering, I became more interested in Artificial Intelligence. Right after getting my college degree, I started studying for a PhD in Computer Sciences.<span class="sacarTexto"> My thesis was about the application of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques to assist designers and developers throughout architectural software design.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                During that time, Marco, Juan Pablo and I met (current partners at Marsie), while all studying and working at ISISTAN, a software research institute at UNICEN.
              </p>
              <p>
                Teaching has also always been at the top of my delights. Since the middle of my undergrad career until present, I’ve been teaching at different levels in multiple national and private universities.
              </p>
              <p>A few years after finishing postgraduate school, I wanted to be more immersed in the software industry and started working as a Research Software Engineer at IBM, where Marco was already working<span class="sacarEnDesktop">.</span><span class="sacarTexto"> in an awesome and simultaneously odd group from IBM Argentina called SilverGate. We were delivering state-of-the-art software to the most prestigious research labs of the company across the globe, meeting all sorts of professionals in the scientific, development, and business worlds.
              </span></p>
              <p class="sacarTexto">
                Now a bit older, much more experienced and with great expectations and energy to focus on doing some things differently, clichés apart, Marsie in fact started in a garage with so many goals and dreams in mind yet only three core principles: excellence, simple rules, and commitment. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m also the proud father of Ines, a young and charming little girl who constantly pushes the limits of reality and teaches me how to become a better parent and man.
              </p>
              <p>
              Music is and has always been present at all times of my life<span class="sacarEnDesktop">.</span><span class="sacarTexto">: walking by the sea very early in the morning, cooking, doing chores, working… you name it.</span> I play some instruments for fun as well, and love to sing along with my daughter. I also take great pleasure in tasting coffee and wine<span class="sacarEnDesktop">, becoming a passion of mine.</span><span class="sacarTexto">; learning about them and enjoying the sensorial experience has turned into a passion of mine.</span>

              <p><span class="sacarTexto">I was born in the spring of 1980, in a small and calm laid-back city of Argentina’s Atlantic coast. I am certain that my childhood games defined my path in life. </span>At the early age of 10, I knew that what I liked the most, besides playing, was discovering and building things. I knew I wanted to become an engineer.
              </p>
              <p>
              I studied Software Engineering in Tandil, <span class="sacarTexto">a valley surrounded by hills, </span>where my love for mountain biking was born.
              </p>
              <p>
              As a university student I achieved good results, calling the attention of a local company that hired me<span class="sacarEnDesktop"> and my </span><span class="sacarTexto"> to develop a document management system to certify ISO standards. My </span>first professional steps were taken together with JP, one of Marsie's partners. Later, the CONICET  granted me a PhD scholarship, same with Agus - the other partner -<span class="sacarEnDesktop">.</span><span class="sacarTexto">, to solve a service-oriented system development issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="sacarTexto">
              Shortly after I completed my thesis, the ANSES  asked the research team I was part of for the migration of 32 Customer Information Control System (CICS) transactions, running in a rented mainframe. The last 50 years of Argentineans history, from births to deaths, required a cost-effective migration to a programming language and a horizontal scalable architecture. The Project lasted a year and a vital  knowledge base was built in regards to Top-Down vs Bottom-Up migrations.
              </p>
              <p>In 2011 I also worked with an Agriculture Consultancy Business, Viento Sur (South Wind) to enable an agricultural production process named direct seeding. <span class="sacarTexto"> We designed a GIS system that made pest monitoring by hectare a reality, with a searchable map and geo-referenced hectares, simplifying data load and reports creation. It has been active for 10 years already, counting more than 100k hectares monitored up to date.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
              At the beginning of 2013 I joined IBM as part of a Research & Development Team based in Argentina to support 12 worldwide scattered research labs. <span class="sacarTexto">Concepts such as ‘home-office, ‘full-remote’ became part of my life. </span> At IBM, I traveled a lot, and got to know wonderful people and great labs at an inspiring company<span class="sacarEnDesktop">. IBM also had multiple resources for patent inventions, and I decided to explore the process, by becoming the main-speaker at IBM 2014 Latin-America Patents Summit and honorably mentored the first Argentinean ‘Master Inventor’. At IBM, my technical career overlapped with my role as ‘people manager’ (PM) for three years in a row.</span> <span class="sacarTexto">that offered me the opportunity to build systems that integrated machine learning with medical histories and genetic info for new health treatments or pharmaceutical drugs, to platforms for human-machine interfaces.</span>

              In 2019, my family and I had to say goodbye to my dad. Together with my son’s birth -Pedro- in 2016, these have been major turning points in my personal life. The sum of experiences, both personal and professional, led me to rethink some pre-established rules in the software industry. Marsie’s creation could be glimpsed.

              Also in 2019, we got together again with Agus and JP, this time in part virtually, as JP now lives in Tandil and Agus and I dwell in Mar del Plata, to create Marsie, and combine the new hiring model with our contractors well-being. Marsie is designed as a fair, transparent, and agile working framework updated for engineers.

              I am the elder son of a Psychologist mother and an ironware businessman, who took on the business founded in Tandil, Argentina by his Italian father. 
              </p>
              <p>
              As a young 7 year old I had my first programming experience, attending a Logo workshop using a Texas Instruments TI-99 computer. At the same time, the Radio world appealed to me, getting my amateur radio license two years later.
              </p>
              <p>
              At the age of 14 an AT 80386DX computer got home thanks to a huge economic effort from my parents. That same computer saw my first coding lines/apps in Turbo Pascal when I started high-school.
              </p>
              <p>
              In 1998 I started System Engineering at UNICEN Tandil, being a producer and broadcaster simultaneously at a Rock & Humor radio program that would last 12 years.
              </p>
              <p>
              Years went by, vast knowledge was gained, and my first work experience in the software industry in an investigative internship at ISISTAN came up; where I met Agustin and Marco, with whom I share many stories and interests.
              </p>
              <p>
              Once I graduated from Software Engineering I decided to fully shift to the private software sector where I mainly worked in the development of workflow engines, distributed systems for real-time communication, OTT services for movie streaming, and blockchain technology. In that path, I faced the first challenges as Technical Lead that were overcome to become Leader of multiple simultaneous development teams for various clients in the USA.
              </p>
              <p>
              In the personal sphere, I experienced the wonder of becoming María Mercedes' father, and a couple of years later our paths with Agus and Marco crossed again, all of us with the same passion as always for software engineering.
              </p>
              <p>
              My strength is the communication of ideas and concepts. My interests are current social affairs, reading, and researching. As a professional, I feel the call of making our world a place where we can live longer and happier. As a human being, I feel responsible for setting this example every single day of my life.

              </p>
              <p>
              Back then, we talked about software engineering as a well-defined, predictable and organized process; but mainly about software architecture as the spinal cord of the first one. Those were the times of CMM, CMMI and the still well-known books series from the Software Engineering Institute. We also started our first POCs in AI (artificial intelligence), more a promise than an effective solution by then.
              </p>
              <p>
              Once I graduated from Software Engineering I decided to fully shift to the private software sector where I mainly worked in the development of workflow engines, distributed systems for real-time communication, OTT services for movie streaming, and blockchain technology. In that path, I faced the first challenges as Technical Lead that were overcome to become Leader of multiple simultaneous development teams for various clients in the USA.
              </p>
              <p>
              In the personal sphere, I experienced the wonder of becoming María Mercedes' father, and a couple of years later our paths with Agus and Marco crossed again, all of us with years of experience and knowledge and the same passion as always for software engineering.
              </p>
              <p>
              My strength is the communication of ideas and concepts. My interests are current social affairs, reading, researching, and understanding consequences and possible solutions. I am in constant contact with experts from many areas and fields related to technology and social organization, to help in the business decision making. I am really into  multi-disciplinary projects. 
              </p>
              <p>
              As a professional, I feel the call of making our world a place where we can live longer and happier. As a human being, I feel responsible for setting this example every single day of my life.
